**OLD URI:** Please, paste old URI.
**NEW URI:** Please, write the new URI.
**REASON:** Please, provide reasons why the URI should be corrected.

**NOTE:** Please, paste the *old* URI into the header. If you think the death date or the author's name should be changed in all URIs of that author, please fill in the author URI only (e.g., 0255Jahiz). If you think something needs to change in the title of a book, in all versions, please fill in the book URI only (e.g., 0255Jahiz.Hayawan). Finally, if a URI change relates only to a specific version of the book, fill in the Version URI (e.g., 0255Jahiz.Hayawan.Shamela0000001-ara1).
