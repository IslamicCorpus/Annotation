# Annotation

The complete description of the annotation workflow can be found [here](). Steps below only explain the preocess of selection of a text for annotation.

1. Open the [priority list](https://github.com/OpenITI/Annotation/blob/master/priority_list.csv). It is organized chronologically. Texts with `priority` are the ones that should be annotated. 
2. While the priority list will be updated regularly, one should check if a text is not being annotated. To do so, go to [issues](https://github.com/OpenITI/Annotation/issues) and, in the Field **FILTER**, search for the URI of the book that you want to annotate (use either complete URI, like `0597IbnJawzi.Muntazam`, or Author's URI `0597IbnJawzi`, or the title of the book like `Muntazam`; **note:** if you search for `IbnJawzi` nothing will be found).
